# **About Me**

Hello, I am Herman Mak (麥翰文).

I am currently a PhD candidate in theoretical and numerical fluid mechanics and aeroelasticity at École polytechnique and ONERA - The French Aerospace Lab. I am deeply interested in uncovering the fascinating secrets of turbulence, aerodynamics, and their interaction with transportation (ground/air/space), renewable energy infrastructure, or any other parts of our built environment. I also have a wider interest in anything physics, engineering, mathematics, technology, and scientific communication/teaching. Moreover, I am highly trained in my degrees not only in aerospace engineering and fluid mechanics, but also in research, data analysis, communication, collaboration, and critical, creative, interdisciplinary thinking. Please find below a short overview of my education and experience so far, or alternatively [view my full CV here](../assets/build/Mak_H_CV.pdf).
