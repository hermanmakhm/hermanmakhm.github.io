# **About Me**

Hello, I am Herman Mak (麥翰文).

I am a fluid dynamics engineer with a doctoral-level research background in theoretical and numerical fluid mechanics and aeroelasticity at École polytechnique and ONERA - The French Aerospace Lab. I am deeply interested in uncovering the fascinating secrets of turbulence, aerodynamics, and their interaction with transportation (ground/air/space), infrastructure, or any other parts of our built environment. I also have a wider interest in the social sciences and how the human world works. I therefore like to apply creative, critical, interdisciplinary, detailed thinking in everything I approach. Please find below a short overview of my education and experience so far, or alternatively [view my full CV here](../assets/build/Herman_Mak_CV.pdf).

Language spoken: English (native), Cantonese (native), Mandarin (C2), French (B2-C1).
