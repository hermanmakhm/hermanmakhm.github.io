- title: MSc Advanced Aeronautical Engineering<br>Imperial College London
  from: 10/2020
  to: 09/2021
  description: I am currently on course for a Distinction after having completed modules on a broad range of topics related to aeronautical engineering including aerodynamics (including turbulence, flow control, aeroservoelasicity, compressible flows, and Computational Fluid Dynamics), structural dynamics, control theory, AI, spaceflight mechanics, aircraft design, and airworthiness. I am currently completing a research project to correct an error in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4638">Chernyshenko's (2013)</a> prediction of the net power saved by utilising sinusoidal walls (i.e. wall roughness) to emulate spatial spanwise oscillation.

  from: 09/2016
  to: 05/2020
  description: At Quest, after completing a set of foundation courses, each student chooses a Question to focus their third and fourth years. I chose investigated the above Question "How do fluids affect vehicles?" To this end, I self studied fluid dynamics, took classes in physics and maths, and completed a final project based on my research project at the University of Southampton. <br><br> Quest is an innovative liberal arts and sciences university, where courses with no more than 20 students are taken one at a time in sequential, intensive, immersive month-long blocks of inquiry based learning, promoting collaboration with peers and professors in group/individual projects.

- title: Visiting Research Student<br>University of Southampton
  from: 10/2019
  to: 01/2020
  description: I conducted particle image velocimetry of cambered and symmetric aerofoils at different angles of attack in low Reynolds number flow in a water tunnel to observe vortex shedding and coherent structures from the separated flow (see ).

- title: Education Technology Intern<br>Independent Schools Foundation Academy
  from: 06/2018
  to: 08/2018
  description: I managed the school's online learning platform during an unexpected staff vacancy by taking the initiative to learn HTML, Javascript, and MySQL to help the transition from one school year to the next. As a result, I was able to perform my tasks and user requests much quicker, culminating in a project to automate a yearly process, which put the team I worked with weeks ahead of schedule.
